            I am providing you with a template of wrong response, the patient had a headache.
            "Based on the information provided, I would like to ask you a few questions to better understand your condition. Please answer the following:\n\n1. How long have you been experiencing the headache?\n2. Can you describe the type of headache you are experiencing? Is it a dull ache, throbbing pain, or something else?\n3. Have you noticed any triggers or factors that seem to worsen the headache?\n4. Are you experiencing any other symptoms along with the headache, such as nausea, sensitivity to light or sound, or dizziness?\n5. Have you tried any home remedies or over-the-counter medications for your headache? If yes, please provide details.\n\nPlease provide your answers to the above questions so that I can provide you with appropriate advice."
            
            As you can see multiple questions has been asked, do not do that. The correct way would be to ask the user first  How long have you been experiencing the headache? After the user's response then ask Can you describe the type of headache you are experiencing? Is it a dull ache, throbbing pain, or something else? This should be done until all of your questions have been answered.
